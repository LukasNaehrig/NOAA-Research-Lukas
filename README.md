## Documents: Classification_Test & Classification_Model_LNaehrig
- Experimenting with different models
- Most up-to-date models
- Neural Net model (functioning, not scaled, accuracy ~ 40%)
- SVM Model (functioning, run time too long to evaluate)
- ADABoost Model (not functioning, data type errors)

## Document: RunInLab
- Designed to be run for multiple days
- Neural Network data
- Trained on 90% of data (99 million rows of data)
- Tested on remaining 10%
- Unscaled data, could lead to problems with neural net
