## Document: Final NNet Model
- This document should be run in the lab for ~3 days.
- This is the final version of our Neural Network Model
- Size: 9
- Decay: 0.7
- Suggested Number of Data points: ~ 300,000

## Document: Binary NNet Model
- Adding T/F columns to data frame
- Neural Net Model regresses 11 categories over numeric columns
- Future steps: Interpretation of prediction, scaling of data, accuracy measure

## Documents: Classification_Test & Classification_Model_LNaehrig
- Experimenting with different models
- Most up-to-date models
- Neural Net model (functioning, not scaled, accuracy ~ 40%)
- SVM Model (functioning, run time too long to evaluate)
- ADABoost Model (not functioning, data type errors)

## Document: RunInLab
- Designed to be run for multiple days
- Neural Network data
- Trained on 90% of data (99 million rows of data)
- Tested on remaining 10%
- Unscaled data, could lead to problems with neural net
